# mMusicCast

Simple chromecast emulator writen in javascript on top of electron.
### Supported applications:

Currently Spotify playback doesn't give any feedback in the UI. For a future release I plan to display what is playing and add controls.

* raspberryPi


### Install & run
* `npm install`

Open Youtube or Spotify app on your phone and enjoy streaming ;)
